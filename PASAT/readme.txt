<b> THIS IS THE NON ADAPTIVE PASAT, SO FOR COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT PURPOSES </b>

Custom jsPsych plugin used; jspsych-audio-button-response-mk.js
Adaptation of jspych-aduio-button-response. 

For visual purposes to work properly, also 'aanvullend.css' has to be downloaded. Also refered to in .html file.

Task-specific transfer of the CCT was evaluated using the non-adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT). 
This paradigm measures cognitive control by examining the ability to update working memory, 
but also loads on multiple cognitive functions such as sustained attention and inhibition. 

During this task, digits (1 to 9) are serially presented in increasing speed, 
and participants are asked to respond to the sum of the last two presented digits (2 to 18) 
by clicking the corresponding digit on the screen. Our version of the task consisted of a practice block containing 16 trials 
(ITI = 4000 ms), followed by three blocks containing 60 trials each (ITI Block 1 = 3000 ms, ITI Block 2 = 2000 ms, ITI Block 3 = 1500 ms).
